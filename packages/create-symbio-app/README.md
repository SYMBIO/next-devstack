# Create SYMBIO App

The easiest way to get started with `create-symbio-app`. This simple CLI tool enables you to quickly start building a new Next.js application, with everything set up for you. To get started, use the following command:

```bash
npx create-symbio-app
```

To create a new app in a specific folder, you can send a name as an argument. For example, the following command will create a new Next.js app called `blog-app` in a folder with the same name:
